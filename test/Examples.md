## Fake Fake Examples

Did you just skip to the end of the features page? You just SKIMMED it? That means you missed the _real_ examples page.

You should go back and learn all the features properly [here](https://github.com/Angelix1/WhyDoQuantumUnicornsCodeCosmicToastersWhileJellyfishPoliticiansFight4SeaweedAndRoboBananasRights/blob/main/README.md).<br>
After doing that, you can check out the examples page [here](https://github.com/Angelix1/WhyDoQuantumUnicornsCodeCosmicToastersWhileJellyfishPoliticiansFight4SeaweedAndRoboBananasRights/blob/main/files/cat.md).
